## Article

> 'Inequality is an inevitable product of capitalist activity, and expanding equality of opportunity only increases it' - Muller, 2013

To preface this article, this will not be a direct critique of capitalism or how modern corporations generate profit;
instead, this article aims to provide AI researchers with insight into the potential harms present within training data
and how they can leverage their knowledge of this to work towards a more just society. As I hold left-wing political
values myself, this article may contain bold statements that lean on the verge of anti-capitalist ideologies.

Turning our attention to the subject at hand, AI's negative impact on equality can be seen in recent articles, such as
[Kristalina Georgieva's analysis of AI impacts on the Global Economy [18]](https://www.imf.org/en/Blogs/Articles/2024/01/14/ai-will-transform-the-global-economy-lets-make-sure-it-benefits-humanity)
