## Pro2 Summer School Presentation

Description: In July, I presented my research progress at the [Pro2 Network+](https://prosquared.org/) [Device Prototyping Summer School](https://prosquared.org/2025-summer-school/).
The presentation focuses on the state of the research at the time, how the research sits within the 'Long Tail of Hardware',
and advice for future researchers based on the mistakes and lessons learnt during the first year of research. \
