## The UX of AI

Description: Artificial intelligence (AI) is a powerful tool for intelligent decision-making; however, there is an
urgent need for a better understanding of how AI can be developed with a focus on user experience. This literature
review aims to identify gaps within user experience research regarding AI, highlight current discussions in interactive
AI design, discuss principles for designing trustworthy and human-centred AI, and link existing design heuristics to
interactive AI design. \

## Chatbot with a Persona

Description: This study uses modern LLMs to attempt the ConvAI2 competition. The competition’s goal was to create a
conversational AI that could generate a suitable response to user inputs, given a dialogue history and a description of
the agent’s persona. This study developed a system for evaluating LLMs for this task using human feedback. Using the
developed system, three models were implemented for testing; it was found that modern LLMs can produce suitable outputs
deemed representative of a persona but struggle to convey them naturally. Hyperparameters were also analysed, with
findings indicating that increasing temperature increases the naturalness of outputs and top_p increases result in
better persona representation. \
