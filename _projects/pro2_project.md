# About the Summer School

The project was submitted to the [pro² network+](https://prosquared.org/) [device prototyping and production summer school](https://prosquared.org/2024-summer-school); this three-day event included presentations, demos, hands-on lab-based tutorials, panels, and discussions on building refined and robust prototypes.
I attended the summer school on a sponsored place for the initial project proposal.
During the summer school, I gained professional insight into PCB design and manufacture, component selection and sourcing, and designing for manufacturing.
I had hands-on experience with surface mount assembly, reliable firmware, and testing through [solder:bit](https://github.com/devices-lab/solderbit-gamepad).
Many great projects were presented over the course of the summer school, such as [Wakayima](https://prosquared.org/2024-LSS-Papers/2024-LSS-Boyd-paper.pdf) and [Print and Place Isotyping Board](https://prosquared.org/2024-LSS-Papers/2024-LSS-Child-paper.pdf), with prizes given to those that showed the greatest potential for impact.
My project was selected for one of the [three £1000 awards by the pro² network+](https://www.linkedin.com/posts/prosquaredplus_pro2summerschool2024-activity-7237388586831032321-ssCH?utm_source=share&utm_medium=member_desktop), which will be used to fund the studies and ensure end-users can receive prototypes for free. 

# The Idea

# Future of the Study

This study will be developed incrementally through different projects.
[VirtualLeverless]({{ site.url }}/projects/virtualleverless) will develop a customisable virtual controller, to enable the collection of user controller layout preferences.
[ControllerForge]({{ site.url }}/projects/controllerforge) will use the data collected by [VirtualLeverless]({{ site.url }}/projects/virtualleverless) to generate 3D-printable controllers that are tailored to user needs.
[GeneRoute]({{ site.url }}/projects/generoute) enable for 3D-printed circuitry, through optimising conductive filament wiring within [ControllerForge]({{ site.url }}/projects/controllerforge).
The proposed research project will build on [ControllerForge]({{ site.url }}/projects/controllerforge) to enable the modular design and creation of user-tailored controllers.
