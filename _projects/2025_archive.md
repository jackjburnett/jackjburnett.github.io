## Pro2 Summer School Presentation

In July, I presented my research progress at the [Pro2 Network+](https://prosquared.org/) [Device Prototyping Summer School](https://prosquared.org/2025-summer-school/).
The presentation, which can be found [here]({{ site.url }}assets/pptx/Pro2_Graduate_Presentation.pptx){:target="\_blank"},
focused on the state of the research at the time, how it fit into the 'Long Tail of Hardware', and my advice for future researchers
based on the mistakes and lessons learnt.
